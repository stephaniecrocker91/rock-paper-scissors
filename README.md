### Our Services Page - _ourservices.html_

* * *

Our services section is set up on another HTML page. Its aim is to describe in detail the services we provide. It is structured as follows:

*   A header: "Our Bespoke Packages", which clearly describes what we offer.
*   A sub-header: lists the specific services we offer: Meditation, Yoga, Pilates, Hiit and Nutrition. Each service listed hyperlinks to the section of the page with a more detailed description of that particular service.
*   A small paragraph: in a white box detailing how the service packages.
*   This first section has an image-background that is easy on the eye, subtle and allows the text over it to be easily read.

Each one of the hyperlinks at the top of this page take the user to a sub-section containing:

*   A header: with the service name (E.g.: MINDFULNESS & MEDITATION). The background color is dusty pink, and the font is uppercase. It makes for a clear distinction between the different services sections.
*   An image: that portrays the service to the user.
*   A few paragraphs: about the service and it's benefits. On small screens (mobile and some tablets) the paragraph is directly below the image. On larger displays, the paragraphs are to the right of the image.
*   A "Back to Top" link: This hyperlink which takes the user back to the top of the page. It is italicized and underlined so as to stand out.

## SKELETON:

### WIREFRAMES:
* I began designing from a mobile display. I wanted my nav and footer to always be displayed. I wanted a homepage image to load up immediately. I wanted the form section to have a background image.

<img src="assets/images/wireframe-mobile4.png" width="200px">

* For the wide screen display, I had a rough idea of how I wanted the Homepage and services section displayed. I wanted the image in the home page to be large and inviting, with introduction to the site below. I wanted the services section to be laid out with HEADER, Image to the left and paragraph to the right.
